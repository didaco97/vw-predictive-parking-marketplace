## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Urban Parking Crisis

- 🚦 **Traffic Chaos**: Drivers spend **30-40%** of city driving time searching for parking
- 💨 **Environmental Impact**: Excessive fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions from circling blocks  
- 💸 **Wasted Resources**: Unused private driveways and office lots sit empty while drivers struggle
- 📱 **Current Apps Fall Short**: Only show real-time data, no predictive intelligence or marketplace

> **Challenge**: Build a real-time parking prediction system that allows users to find and pre-book slots, reducing wait times and improving urban mobility. Integrate predictions, bookings, and payments into a seamless mobile experience.
